# Music-Interval-Quiz-Generator
This is just a simple little quiz generator I made to make a quick worksheet to teach myself music intervals.

Inspiration from Ben Levin's "How to Name Intervals - Music Theory from the Ground Up Lesson 4". At the time of me writing this, this could be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSy8_Sl0AMc&index=4&list=PLJTWoPGfHxQH5zdZN6UlMPwZerVApkqmk

(I'm sure you're a quick Google away from it if you can't find it though. ;))
